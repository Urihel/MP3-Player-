# MP3-Player
This is just a basic model of an mp3 player built on HTML5, CSS3, javaScript. It currently uses an m4a file which you can 
transfer from device to computer. The process for the m4a file is quite simple, on windows 10+ you can simply attach your usb cable to phone 
at the bottom of right hand corner of the screen it should upload you phone and a message saying you phone was recognized should appear 
click on it immediately. it should take you to the main folders screen of your phone. if you locate you a phone recorder folder you 
audio file should be inside there. considering you have renamed it and know how to identify it on your computer you right click and copy the file 
onto you doc and script folder and paste it to there.
